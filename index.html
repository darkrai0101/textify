<p>The Hon. Francis Gillette, in a speech in Hartford, Conn., in 1871, said
			that there was in Connecticut, on an average, one liquor shop to every
			forty voters, and three to every Christian church. In this city, as stated
			in the _Hartford Times_, recently, we have five hundred liquor shops, and
			one million eight hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars were, last
			year, paid for intoxicating drinks. A cry, an appeal, came to me from the
			city, a few days since, after this wise: Our young men are going to
			destruction, and we want your influence, counsel, and prayers, to help
			save them.</p>

			<p>In New London, report says, the young men are falling into drinking habits
			as never before. So in New Haven, Bridgeport, and the other cities and
			large places of the state.</p>

			<p>The pulse of a person in health beats about seventy strokes a minute, and
			the ordinary term of life is about seventy years. In these seventy years,
			the pulse of a temperate person beats two billion five hundred and
			seventy-four million four hundred and forty thousand times. If no actual
			disorganization should happen, a drunken person might live until his pulse
			beat this number of times; but by the constant stimulus of ardent spirits,
			or by pulse-quickening food, or tobacco, the pulse becomes greatly
			accelerated, and the two billion five hundred and seventy-four million
			four hundred and forty thousand pulsations are performed in little more
			than half the ordinary term of human life, and life goes out in forty or
			forty-five years, instead of seventy. This application of numbers is given
			to show that the acceleration of those forces diminishes the term of human
			life.</p>

			<p>In New York, Mr. Greeley states that a much larger proportion of adult
			males in the state drink now than did in 1840-44. After speaking of the
			adverse demonstrations all over the country, he adds, I cannot recall a
			single decisive, cheering success, to offset these many reverses.</p>

			<p>Massachusetts is moving to build an asylum for her twenty-five thousand
			drunkards. Lager beer brewers at Boston Highlands have three millions of
			dollars invested in the business, manufactured four hundred and
			ninety-five thousand barrels last year, and paid a tax of half a million
			to the general government. <b>The city of Chicago, last year, received into
			her treasury one hundred and ten thousand dollars for the sale of
			indulgences to sell intoxicating</b> drinks.</p>

			<p>The same rate of fearful expenditure for intoxicating drinks extends
			across the ocean. In a speech before the Trades Union Congress, last
			October, at Birmingham, on the disorganization of labor, Mr. Potter
			shows drunkenness to be the great disorganizer of the labor of Great
			Britain, at a yearly cost of two hundred and twenty-eight million pounds,
			equal to one billion one hundred and forty million dollars; enough, he
			adds, to pay the public debt of Great Britain in less than five years,
